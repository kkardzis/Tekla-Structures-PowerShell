# Tekla-Structures-PowerShell

Repository contains information about using PowerShell to interact with Tekla Structures through Tekla Open API. You can find here examples of how to configure things and examples of how PowerShell can be used to automate some common engineering tasks in Tekla.

There is no need to install anything. All tools and libraries comes pre-installed with Windows or with Tekla Structures, which is a perfect fit for restricted environments, like corporate computers, where usually it is not so easy to install any additional software. Anyway, few optional tools may simplify things: [code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [modern terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/terminal), or [git](https://git-scm.com/). Personally I prefer to use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) for installing such little gems.

# Configuration
